Hello and welcome to my Personal Portfolio! Here you can find out all about me! ^_^ 

This is my first Wordpress website built entirely using HTML, CSS, and a tiny bit of Javascript. Untracked are the PHP files and new changes to clean up design & tie things together with backend. To see the live site please visit [site URL to come].

For easier backend support, style.css is the most recent, consolidated stylesheet file for this project. All other stylesheet files are previous versions that were made separately and are no longer in use. 

This is not a finished project. Changes that still need to be made include:
    1. Clean up stylesheet redundancies for easier readibility & version control
    2. Configure SMTP settings for contact form to function
    3. Configure subsciption box to function
    4. Make each respective nav link highlight upon active page 
    5. & more

P.S. I worked really hard on this project; please refrain from plagiarizing this code!
