Hello and welcome to my Personal Portfolio! Here you can find out all about me! ^_^ 

This is my first Wordpress website built entirely using HTML, CSS, and a tiny bit of Javascript. Not included are the PHP files and new changes to clean up design & tie things together. To see the live site please visit [site URL to come].

This is not a finished project. Changes that still need to be made include:
    1. Consolidate all CSS into one file or as few as possible and clean up redundancies for easier readibility & version control
    2. Configure SMTP settings for contact form to function
    3. Configure subsciption box to function
    4. Make each respective nav link highlight upon active page 
    5. & more

P.S. I worked really hard on this project; please refrain from plagiarizing this code!
